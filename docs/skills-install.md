# Installing the Magpie skill

The Magpie skill lets AI agents (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, etc.) drive Magpie through documented CLI patterns when MCP is not available. The skill lives in this repo under **`skills/magpie/`** (IDE-neutral). Install it into each editor’s skills directory with the script below, or follow the manual copy steps.

## Install script (recommended)

From the Magpie repository root:

```bash
# Optional: make the script executable once
chmod +x skills/install-skill.sh

# Global install (default): user home, e.g. ~/.cursor/skills/magpie
./skills/install-skill.sh cursor
./skills/install-skill.sh claude
./skills/install-skill.sh codex
./skills/install-skill.sh all

# Explicit global scope (same as omitting the flag)
./skills/install-skill.sh cursor --global

# Project scope: current working directory
./skills/install-skill.sh cursor --project

# Project scope: specific directory
./skills/install-skill.sh claude --project /path/to/your/project

# Help
./skills/install-skill.sh -h
```

**Behavior:** The script removes any existing destination folder named `magpie` and copies `skills/magpie` there. No editor restart is usually required.

**Related docs:** [Analyze vs Compare](analysis_compare.md), [Benchmark mode](benchmark.md), [README](../README.md) (MCP vs skill).

## Manual install

Source folder: **`skills/magpie/`** in this repo (contains `SKILL.md`, `reference.md`, `examples.md`).

### Cursor

- **Global:** Copy the skill into your Cursor skills folder:
  ```bash
  cp -r /path/to/Magpie/skills/magpie ~/.cursor/skills/magpie
  ```
- **Project:** Copy into your project’s Cursor skills folder so only that project uses it:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p /path/to/your/project/.cursor/skills
  cp -r /path/to/Magpie/skills/magpie /path/to/your/project/.cursor/skills/magpie
  ```
  (Replace `/path/to/Magpie` and `/path/to/your/project` with the actual paths.)

### Claude Code

Same `SKILL.md` format and layout.

- **Global:**
  ```bash
  mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
  cp -r /path/to/Magpie/skills/magpie ~/.claude/skills/magpie
  ```
- **Project:**
  ```bash
  mkdir -p /path/to/your/project/.claude/skills
  cp -r /path/to/Magpie/skills/magpie /path/to/your/project/.claude/skills/magpie
  ```

### Codex and other IDEs

- If the IDE has a **skills** or **custom instructions** directory (e.g. `~/.codex/skills/` or a project `.codex/skills/`), copy the **`magpie`** directory there:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
  cp -r /path/to/Magpie/skills/magpie ~/.codex/skills/magpie
  ```
  Use the path your IDE documents for custom skills.
- If the IDE only has a **single “custom instructions”** or “rules” field, paste the body of [skills/magpie/SKILL.md](../skills/magpie/SKILL.md) (the markdown after the YAML frontmatter) into that field, and add a note that these instructions apply when working with Magpie, GPU kernel analysis/compare, or vLLM/SGLang benchmarks.

## Verifying the skill

1. **Discovery:** In the target IDE, ask: “What can you do with Magpie?” or “I want to analyze a HIP kernel with Magpie.” The agent should use the Magpie skill (reference its instructions or run Magpie commands).
2. **Correctness:** Ask “Show GPU info using Magpie.” The agent should run `magpie --gpu-info` or `python -m Magpie --gpu-info` from the Magpie repo (or from a directory where Magpie is installed).
3. **CLI check:** From the Magpie repo root, run `magpie --gpu-info` (or `python -m Magpie --gpu-info`) to confirm the CLI and environment work.
